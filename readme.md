# Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

This project utilizes computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR) to develop an automated system for detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates. The system provides real-time monitoring and managing of vehicular activity, serving as a powerful tool for tracking lost vehicles.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python and Anaconda to be installed on your system. Additionally, it uses several Python packages including TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTesseract, and others. All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file included in the project.

Python can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### Installing

After you've installed Python and Anaconda, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

3. Set up a new Anaconda environment:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your environment and `python=3.8` with the Python version you want to use.

4. Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

5. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
